- OpenAI API key (for chatbot functionality)

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Using PowerShell (Recommended)
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

### Option 2: Using Command Prompt
```cmd
setup.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
```bash

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Variables

Before running the app, set your OpenAI API key:

### Windows (Command Prompt)
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### macOS/Linux
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Running the Application

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Windows
